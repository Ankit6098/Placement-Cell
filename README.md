The Placement Cell Project is a feature-rich web application developed using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, with a primary focus on optimizing the job placement process. It incorporates robust user authentication through Passport.js, allowing both administrators and users to access the platform securely.

For Users:

Authentication Options: Users can choose to log in using their Google or GitHub accounts, ensuring a seamless and secure sign-in experience.
Personalized Greetings: Upon login, users receive a personalized welcome email from the placement cell, enhancing their engagement.
Profile Management: Users have the capability to update their profiles, ensuring that their information is up-to-date and attractive to potential employers.
Job Application: Users can browse and apply for job listings posted by the admin, simplifying the application process.
Application Tracking: The system allows users to monitor the status of their applications, providing transparency throughout the application journey.
Job Discovery: Users can explore various job listings across different domains, expanding their employment opportunities.

For Admins:

Enhanced Control: Administrators have privileged access to a dedicated dashboard, granting them full control over the platform's functionalities.
Application Management: Admins can efficiently manage applicants, assigning interviews or rejecting applications as per their recruitment needs.
Job Posting: The admin can post job listings in various domains, facilitating recruitment across different fields and tailoring the platform to specific needs.
Data Analysis: The system supports the export of interview details as CSV files, enabling admins to perform in-depth analysis for better decision-making.
User Notifications: iZiToast is integrated into the system for client-side notifications, offering a visually appealing and clear notification mechanism to both admins and users.
This project provides an efficient, user-friendly, and secure platform, differentiating the experiences of job seekers (users) and administrators, ultimately streamlining and optimizing the entire placement process.
